## Inspiration

The inspiration for Wiki Wager stemmed from the highly anticipated Turkey 2023 General Elections. We recognized the excitement and interest surrounding political events and saw an opportunity to create an innovative platform that combines the power of blockchain technology, decentralized oracles, and artificial intelligence to revolutionize the way people engage with wiki-based events.

## What it does

Wiki Wager is a cutting-edge betting platform that allows users to place bets on the outcomes of wiki-based events, starting with the Turkey 2023 General Elections. By leveraging decentralized oracle networks and advanced AI models, we provide users with accurate event result predictions and a transparent betting environment.

Users can access the platform, browse through a list of candidates, and place bets on their preferred outcomes. Through the integration of Functions, a decentralized oracle network, we fetch event results from trusted sources such as Wikipedia articles. These results are then analyzed using the powerful GPT-3.5 Turbo AI model to generate predictions.

## How we built it

Building Wiki Wager involved a multidimensional approach that combined various technologies and methodologies. The platform is built on Next.js, a popular framework for building React applications. We utilized smart contracts to ensure transparency and security in the betting process. Additionally, we integrated Functions, a decentralized oracle network, to fetch event results and facilitate accurate predictions.

To analyze event results, we harnessed the power of GPT-3.5 Turbo, a state-of-the-art AI model, to extract insights from the structured data in Wikipedia articles. By combining these technologies, we created a seamless and user-friendly betting experience that enables participants to engage in wiki-based event predictions.

## Challenges we ran into

One of the main challenges we encountered was the unavailability of a public API for official election results. To overcome this hurdle, we made use of Wikipedia articles as a source of reliable event information. However, extracting the required data from these articles presented its own set of challenges, such as limited body size in HTTP requests. We optimized our approach by focusing on concise introduction sections, which typically contain the event results.

Another significant challenge was deploying a separate contract with semi-automatic result delivery on the Avalanche network just two days before the Turkey second round of elections. This required extensive testing and coordination to ensure a smooth deployment process.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Throughout the development of Wiki Wager, we have achieved several significant accomplishments:

1. Reliable and timely result delivery: Our API was able to provide reliable event results just three hours after the end of voting, surpassing the official declaration of the winner. This achievement demonstrates the efficiency and accuracy of our result analysis process, enabling users to access timely and trustworthy information.

2. Efficient batch winning distributions: We successfully implemented a batch distribution system for winning payouts. By distributing winnings in batches, we were able to accommodate an unlimited number of participants, ensuring a smooth and efficient payout process for all users. This scalable design allows us to handle large volumes of bets and ensures fairness in the distribution of winnings.

3. Seamless winning claim with a pull mechanism: We introduced a seamless winning claim mechanism using a pull approach. This user-centric design enables participants to claim their winnings effortlessly, providing a frictionless and user-friendly experience. By simplifying the process, we aim to enhance user satisfaction and make the platform more accessible to all.

4. Successful deployment on Avalanche network: Overcoming the challenges of deploying a separate contract with semi-automatic result delivery on the Avalanche network two days before the Turkey second round of elections was a significant achievement. This deployment demonstrated our ability to adapt to different blockchain ecosystems and leverage their capabilities to provide a seamless and secure betting platform.

5. Leveraging Wikipedia as a reliable data source: By utilizing Wikipedia as a source of event information, we tackled the challenge of the unavailability of a public API

for official results. This achievement showcases our innovative approach and adaptability in leveraging existing resources to deliver reliable and accurate event outcomes to our users.

## What we learned

Throughout the development process of Wiki Wager, we learned valuable lessons that have enhanced our understanding of various technologies and methodologies. Specifically, we gained insights into:

1. Building Next.js applications: We acquired expertise in developing applications using the Next.js framework, enabling us to create a seamless and responsive user interface.

2. Making requests to decentralized oracle networks (DON): We learned how to integrate and interact with decentralized oracle networks such as Functions, leveraging their capabilities to fetch and analyze event results in a secure and efficient manner.

3. Writing Functions for result analysis: We acquired the skills to write Functions, allowing us to extract relevant information from Wikipedia articles and perform result analysis using GPT-3.5 Turbo. This expertise empowered us to generate accurate event predictions for our users.

4. Leveraging GPT-3.5 Turbo for event result analysis: We gained proficiency in utilizing advanced AI models, specifically GPT-3.5 Turbo, to analyze event results and generate meaningful insights. This experience expanded our understanding of natural language processing and its applications in event prediction.

## What's next for Wiki Wager

The journey of Wiki Wager does not end here. We have a roadmap of exciting developments planned for the future:
